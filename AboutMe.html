                <h1>Learn More About Me!</h1>
                <p>Hello again! I'm Kaitlyn, a junior computer science major at Iowa State University!<br>I'm from Minnesota, but spent a good portion of my childhood in Connecticut.<br>
                Right now I'm extremely interested in software development, game dev, mobile app dev, AI, and consulting. <br>However, I want to learn and try a bit of everything!I love learning new things and taking on new challenges.
                    <br>Similarly to how I have a lot of interests in computer science, I have lots of interests outside of that as well!<br> I love sports, art, music, media, and pretty much everything under the sun! <br>I'm a very competitive and hardworking person, and I really hope to be able to travel around the world someday!
                </p>
